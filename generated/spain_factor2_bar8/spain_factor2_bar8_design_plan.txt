Chart type
- Paired vertical bar chart (grouped bar chart) across the x-axis = year (1999–2014). Each year shows two adjacent bars: Spain and Euro‑Zone average. Chart canvas in portrait orientation with aspect ratio at least 3:4 (e.g., 900 px wide × 1200 px high or any dimensions where height ≥ 4/3 × width).

Text structure (what text is included, content, and position)
- Title (very short): "Budget Balance (GDP %)"
  - Position: centered at top margin.
  - Rationale: WordCountTitle loading = -0.63 → keep the title extremely short to respect the strong negative loading on title word count. A short title keeps viewers’ attention on the data rather than a long heading.
  - Font size: large but concise (e.g., 28–32 pt for slide/presentation).

- Subtitle (concise, single line): "Spain vs. Euro‑Zone average, 1999–2014"
  - Position: directly under the title, smaller than title.
  - Rationale: Subtitle loading = 0.24 (small positive) → use a brief subtitle to give context without expanding the title; places context where users expect it while keeping title word count low.
  - Font size: 16–18 pt.

- Data value labels on each bar (IdentifyValues): numeric values shown as signed percentages, one decimal (e.g., "-11.2%").
  - Position: placed at the tip of each bar; for negative bars label just below the bar endpoint (inside the negative region) with high-contrast text and a small white halo if needed.
  - Rationale: IdentifyValues loading = 0.53 (strongly positive) → explicitly label every bar so viewers can read exact comparisons at a glance; improves precision and direct comparison.

- Inline series labels (ReplaceMappings → avoid a separate legend): small colored text labels "Spain" and "Euro‑Zone avg" placed once at the left-most pair of bars (or repeated as small tags near the first instance) and/or printed directly on the top edge of the first bar of each series across the years.
  - Position: small label tag (colored square + text) immediately above or beside the first year’s bars; for discoverability, repeat a faded tag in top-right corner near the chart title.
  - Rationale: ReplaceMappings loading = 0.33 → omit the conventional legend and instead map colors directly to text on the chart, reducing eye movement and mapping ambiguity.

- Annotations (anchored, short-form) — multiple targeted callouts:
  - 2004–2007 (pre-crisis surplus run): short anchored annotation reading "Pre‑crisis surpluses (2004–2007): Spain > EZ avg" with a light, thin connector line to the 2006 pair.
  - 2008–2010 (crisis spike): primary annotation for 2009 reading "2009: Spain −11.2% vs EZ −6.3% (largest gap)" with a short arrow pointing to Spain’s 2009 bar; second-line smaller note: "Crisis years deepen deficits".
  - 2014 (end-of-series): short note "2014: deficits narrowed" or similar, anchored near the final pair.
  - Rationale: Annotation and WordCountAnnotation loadings = 0.65 each (very high) → add clear, short annotations to explain the most important differences and historical turning points; allocate more words in annotations (relative to title) as the factor structure indicates annotations should be prominent.
  - Style: annotations are short (6–12 words), high-contrast text, background micro-box with 60–80% opacity, and a thin connector line (Lines loading = 0.25, small positive) to their target bars.

- Axis labels and scales:
  - Y-axis: "Percent of GDP" with the sign convention noted (zero baseline emphasized).
  - X-axis: years (every year labeled 1999–2014). Use vertical ticks; keep year labels medium-large.
  - Rationale: CompareMappings loading = 0.26 (small positive) → make axis semantics explicit and human-readable; ensure viewers understand this is % of GDP and negative values are deficits.

Visual styling and auxiliary elements
- Colors:
  - Spain: deep, moderately saturated red (e.g., dark crimson).
  - Euro‑Zone average: deep, medium-saturated blue (e.g., navy).
  - Use these two contrasting hues to support fast visual comparison; both are strong enough for projection and readable for common forms of color deficiency. Rationale: News loading = 0.46 suggests a clear, attention-getting palette; Style loading = -0.21 slightly negative on decorative color use, so colors should be functional (encode series) rather than decorative. Use only two series colors—no extra decorative colors.

- Zero baseline emphasis:
  - Draw the horizontal zero line as a thicker, darker rule (but not black) to help visually separate deficits (below zero) and surpluses (above zero). Rationale: improves immediate reading of sign and magnitude.

- Gridlines:
  - Light horizontal gridlines at sensible ticks (every 2 or 4 percentage points depending on the final chosen y-axis extent). Keep them subtle (very light gray). Rationale: aids value estimation without dominating the chart.

- Bar treatment:
  - Grouped bars with 60% of available width per group; narrow gutter between pairs and consistent spacing between years.
  - Bars have slight corner radius (2–3 px) for clean modern look.
  - No heavy drop shadows; keep flat for readability (Style negative).

- Data labels styling:
  - High-contrast text (white on dark bars or black on light area) with subtle halo to ensure legibility on both positive and negative bars.
  - Font size: 12–14 pt (presentation-friendly); increase if display is large.

- Annotation connectors and arrows:
  - Use thin connecting lines with a small arrowhead only when needed to disambiguate which bar is annotated (supported by Lines loading = 0.25). Keep arrows lightweight and minimal—avoid thick graphic callouts.

- Highlighting largest differences:
  - For the single most extreme gap (2009), use a subtle box or halo behind the year group and a short text annotation as described above. Because Annotation loading is high, this makes narrative sense and directs attention to the key difference without overwhelming the chart.
  - Keep the halo color a translucent warm gray to avoid clashing with series colors.

- Legend omission:
  - Do not place a traditional legend. Instead, rely on inline series labels and color-coded text near first bars and in the subtitle to map the colors. Rationale: ReplaceMappings positive; direct labels reduce cognitive load.

- Avoid government-style decoration:
  - Do not use governmental seals, formal report typefaces, or bureaucratic footers. Rationale: Government loading = -0.55 (strong negative) — the design should avoid formal government styling and instead be neutral/journalistic.

Typography & sizing (presentation-ready)
- Title: 28–32 pt, semi-bold.
- Subtitle: 16–18 pt, regular.
- Axis labels: 16–18 pt.
- Year ticks: 14–16 pt.
- Data labels on bars: 12–14 pt.
- Annotation text: 14–16 pt for main annotations, 12–14 pt for secondary lines.
- Typeface: clean sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Helvetica Neue, or Arial) for legibility in a presentation.

Y-axis range and scaling
- Set the y-axis from −12.5% to +3.0% (or tight pad around actual min/max) so the largest negative value (Spain −11.2%) is visible with slight breathing room, and positive maxima (Spain 2.4) remain clearly above zero. Rationale: ensures proportional visual impression of deficits vs surpluses and makes the 2009 outlier legible.

Accessibility and contrast
- Ensure text-to-background contrast meets accessible contrast ratios (especially for annotation boxes and data labels).
- For viewers with color vision deficiencies, use patterned fills (light diagonal hatch) only if necessary—prefer strong color contrast and direct inline text labels first.

How these choices map to the loadings (summary)
- Annotation & WordCountAnnotation (0.65 each): Add multiple short anchored annotations and allocate more wording to annotations than to title. These explain the key differences (pre‑crisis surpluses, crisis years, 2009 peak deficit).
- IdentifyValues (0.53): Label all bars with numeric values so comparisons are exact and immediate.
- News (0.46): Use attention-focused but neutral journalistic styling—clear color contrasts and bold callouts—while avoiding formal government cues.
- ReplaceMappings (0.33): Omit a standard legend; instead directly label series in-line on the chart for immediate color→label mapping.
- CompareMappings (0.26) & Lines (0.25): Use short human-readable axis and small connector lines in annotations to translate and connect mappings to viewers.
- Title word-count negative (WordCountTitle −0.63) and Government negative (−0.55): Keep the title extremely short and avoid formal government styling; put explanatory context in subtitle and annotations instead.

Implementation notes
- Aspect ratio: ensure canvas is taller than wide (minimum 3:4 portrait). Adjust font sizes proportionally if using larger canvas.
- Export: produce a high-resolution PNG/PDF for presentation; keep vector export available for slides scaling.
- Data precision: show one decimal place in labels to match data granularity.

This plan centers the visual hierarchy on the data differences (annotations + value labels) while keeping title minimal and avoiding formal government styling—directly reflecting the provided factor loadings.
