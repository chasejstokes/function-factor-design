Chart type
- Paired vertical bar chart (grouped bars) with one group per year on the x-axis (1999–2014). Spain vs. Euro‑zone average bars shown side-by-side within each year. Final three Spain-only years (2012–2014) use a visually distinct “target” treatment (see “Handling NA / targets” below).
- Aspect ratio: portrait orientation, taller than wide, minimum 3:4 (recommend 9 × 12 in or 720 × 960 px). This keeps bars tall for clear visual comparison in presentation.

Text structure (content, placement, and relative emphasis)
1. Title (top, large, single line)
   - Text: “Spain vs. Euro‑zone: Budget balance (% of GDP), 1999–2014”
   - Font size: 28–32 pt (presentation scale).
   - Rationale: Title loading = 0.53. Prominent title aligns with the high loading and immediately orients the viewer to variables displayed.

2. Subtitle (directly below title, slightly smaller, multi‑clause)
   - Text (longer, explicit): “Grouped by year; positive = surplus, negative = deficit. Final three years (2012–2014) are Spain’s official targets, not actual outturns.”
   - Font size: 18–20 pt; weight lighter than title but still highly readable.
   - Rationale: Subtitle loading = 0.67 and WordCountSubtitle = 0.51 (both strongly positive). Include a longer, clarifying subtitle to meet the factor that favors substantive subtitle text. It specifically flags the targets, addressing the user’s focus.

3. Legend (top-right inside chart margin, medium size)
   - Entries:
     - Spain — solid warm red fill (#c0392b)
     - Spain (targets) — same red with diagonal hatch (45°) and 60% opacity
     - Euro‑zone average — cool blue fill (#2b7bb9)
   - Font size: 16–18 pt.
   - Rationale: SummarizeConceptsVariables loading = 0.59 supports explicit variable labels. Clear legend reduces cognitive load and supports quick comparisons.

4. Caption / Explanatory block (bottom, multi-line; prominent)
   - Content lines (short, separate sentences; 2–4 lines):
     - Data source and date: “Data: Eurostat & Spanish Ministry of Finance (compiled by [publisher]), series expressed as % of GDP.”
     - Method/metadata note: “Euro‑zone averages unavailable for 2012–2014; Spain’s 2012–2014 bars are official government targets.”
     - Short interpretive note (valenced, compact): “Notice the sharp divergence during the 2008–2011 crisis: Spain’s deficit deepened more than the Euro average.”
   - Font size: 14–16 pt; left-aligned beneath the chart with a light rule separating it from the plotting area.
   - Rationale: Caption loading = 0.69 and PresentMetadata = 0.63. Strong caption + explicit metadata satisfy the high loadings for explanatory text and provenance. PresentValenced Subtext = 0.38 supports a concise emotionally informative phrase (the interpretive line), but keep it short to avoid sensationalism.

5. Axis titles and tick labels
   - Y-axis label (rotated): “Budget balance (% of GDP)”; font 16–18 pt.
   - X-axis: Year ticks every 1 year (1999–2014). Year labels font 14–16 pt, rotated 0° (horizontal) and bolded for readability.
   - Zero-line label: Emphasize 0 with bolder tick and line.
   - Rationale: Large axis text aligns with the instruction to make text readable in a presentation and supports clarity for comparing positive/negative values.

Visual styling and encoding decisions (each tied to loadings)
1. Color and contrast
   - Spain: warm, saturated red (#c0392b). Euro‑zone average: cool medium blue (#2b7bb9). Background: off-white (#fafafa). Gridlines: very light gray (#e6e6e6).
   - Rationale: Contrasting colors make pairwise differences immediately visible, supporting the viewer’s focus on differences between Spain and the Euro‑zone (SummarizeConceptsVariables loading = 0.59; Title/Subtitles loading also support legibility).

2. Bar shapes and spacing
   - Bars width: relatively thick for presentation (bar width ~60% of group slot) with 8–12 px gap between grouped bars and larger gap between years.
   - Group alignment centered on each year tick.
   - Rationale: Thick, separate bars increase legibility on a projector and help viewers compare adjacent Spain vs. Euro bars (user requested focus on differences).

3. Handling NA and targets (2012–2014)
   - Euro‑zone average missing: omit Euro‑zone bars for 2012–2014 rather than plotting zeros. Display Spain bars for these years with diagonal hatch pattern and 60% opacity to indicate “targets” (legend entry clarifies this).
   - Add a subtle light gray vertical stripe behind 2012–2014 columns and a footnote line in the caption that reiterates “targets, not actuals.”
   - Rationale: PresentMetadata = 0.63 and Subtitle = 0.67 require clear metadata; this visual treatment makes the distinction explicit without cluttering the plot. Omitting Euro bars avoids misleading comparisons for missing data.

4. Minimal in-chart annotation (avoid arrow flourishes)
   - Do not use arrows to call attention to bars (Arrows loading = -0.24 recommends de-emphasis). Also minimize inline text annotations (WordCountAnnotation = -0.27).
   - Instead: place only 1–3 numeric labels (bold, small) above the most extreme points to help the eye:
     - Spain 2009: “-11.2%” (largest deficit)
     - Spain 2006: “2.4%” (largest surplus)
   - Keep those labels concise, sans-serif, 12–14 pt, with slight contrast halo for projection.
   - Rationale: The negative annotation/arrow loadings imply keeping in-chart ornamentation light. Numeric labels are used sparingly to mark extremes that are central to the story.

5. Contextual shading (light, non-intrusive)
   - Add a translucent vertical band (light warm gray, 20% opacity) spanning 2008–2011 to mark the global financial crisis period and make divergence easier to interpret.
   - Rationale: PresentContext = 0.29 (marginally positive) supports including lightweight contextual cues. A subtle band provides context without dominating the visual and avoids arrows or heavy annotation.

6. Grid and zero baseline emphasis
   - Use subtle horizontal gridlines at -12, -8, -4, 0, 4, etc., with the 0 line thicker and darker.
   - Rationale: Emphasizing zero improves the interpretation of deficit vs. surplus and supports the audience’s comparative reading.

7. Legend and labeling hierarchy
   - Legend placed inside the upper-right plotting margin to save vertical space and keep title/subtitle/caption clear.
   - Use consistent label order (Spain first) to reflect the user’s emphasis on Spain differences.
   - Rationale: SummarizeConceptsVariables and Title loadings favor clear variable labeling and hierarchy.

Accessibility and presentation specifics
- Fonts: clean sans-serif (e.g., Open Sans, Lato, or Arial) for legibility on screen.
- Font sizes: Title 28–32 pt; subtitle 18–20 pt; axes 16–18 pt; legend 16 pt; caption 14–16 pt; in-chart numeric labels 12–14 pt.
- Ensure contrast ratios meet good visibility for projector settings (colors and text tested at typical projector brightness).

How each major recommendation ties to the loadings (summary)
- Emphasize caption and metadata (Caption 0.69; PresentMetadata 0.63): include a multi‑line caption with data source, transformations, and a short interpretive sentence. This centralizes provenance and interpretation outside the chart body.
- Prominent subtitle and moderately long subtitle (Subtitle 0.67; WordCountSubtitle 0.51): include a longer subtitle that clarifies data meaning and explicitly marks 2012–2014 as targets.
- Clear variable labeling and legend (SummarizeConceptsVariables 0.59; Title 0.53): explicit legend and concise title to orient viewers to Spain vs. Euro‑zone variables.
- Limit in-chart annotations and avoid arrows (WordCountAnnotation -0.27; Arrows -0.24): avoid decorative arrows and heavy annotations; use only a couple numeric labels for extreme values.
- Avoid blog/media styling; present as an authoritative chart (Blog -0.37; Media -0.31): adopt a neutral, data‑centric, news/journalistic visual (News 0.47 positive) with clear citations—avoid informal blog cues.
- Include modest contextual cue for crisis years (PresentContext 0.29, modestly positive): a subtle vertical band for 2008–2011 to help interpret divergence without intrusive callouts.
- Include a small valenced interpretive sentence in the caption (PresentValenced Subtext 0.38): short, crisp language to highlight the human/economic impact (kept restrained and factual).

Final implementation notes (for the designer/engineer)
- Use data-driven plotting to ensure correct placement and no Euro‑zone bars plotted for NA years.
- Export at presentation resolution (minimum 150–200 dpi for slide use).
- Verify color-blind friendly contrast: test red vs. blue and consider pattern fallback for Spain vs. Euro if necessary (solid vs. dotted fill) while preserving the hatch for targets.
- Keep composition centered vertically to leave space for the caption and legend while maintaining tall aspect ratio.

This plan prioritizes large, readable textual elements (title, subtitle, caption, legend) and clear paired bars to foreground Spain vs. Euro‑zone differences, follows the factor loadings by emphasizing metadata and caption-driven explanation, and minimizes intrusive in-chart decorations (arrows/over-annotations).
