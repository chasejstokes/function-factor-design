Chart type
- Paired (grouped) vertical bar chart by year (x-axis = year), Spain and Euro‑Zone Average as two bars per year.
- Orientation and size: portrait orientation, aspect ratio at least 3:4 (e.g., 900 × 1200 px or 9 in × 12 in) so the chart is taller than wide and legible for presentation.

Reason: paired bars make year-by-year differences explicit and align with the user’s request to focus on differences between Spain and the Euro‑Zone Average.

Text structure (what text appears, content, and position)
1. Title (very short)
   - Text: “Budget Balance (% of GDP)”
   - Position: centered at top
   - Font size: large but concise (approx. 24–28 pt for typical slide dimensions)
   - Justification: WordCountTitle loading = -0.63 (strong negative). Keep the title short to obey the factor loading (minimize title word count).

2. Subtitle (one short line, optional)
   - Text: “Spain vs Euro‑Zone average, 1999–2014”
   - Position: directly under the title, smaller and lighter than title (approx. 14–16 pt)
   - Justification: Subtitle loading = 0.24 (mild positive). Keep it concise: don’t move the explanatory burden here.

3. Inline series labels (replace legend)
   - Text: “Spain” placed near the top-right of the last Spain bar (2014), “Euro‑Zone average” placed near the top-right of the last Euro bar where present (2011)
   - Also include a small inline key for the target pattern: “Spain (target)” with a tiny hatched swatch near the chart top-right
   - Justification: ReplaceMappings loading = 0.33 (positive). Replace a separate legend with direct, in-chart labels to reduce visual parsing and make mappings immediate.

4. Numeric value labels (IdentifyValues emphasized)
   - Show exact value for every bar as a numeric label (e.g., “-11.2”).
   - Placement: at the end/tip of each bar (for negative bars place label just below bar tip; for positive bars place label just above tip); use contrasting text color for readability.
   - Font size: readable for presentation (approx. 12–14 pt).
   - Justification: IdentifyValues loading = 0.53 (strong positive). Explicit value labels reduce ambiguity and highlight differences year-by-year.

5. Annotations (prominent explanatory callouts)
   - Add 4 anchored annotation callouts inside the plotting area (box or lightweight callout) with short headings + 1–2 sentences:
     - 2005–2007 callout (anchored to the 2006 Spain bar): “Mid‑2000s: Spain runs surpluses while the Euro‑Zone average is negative. Spain 2006: +2.4% vs EZ avg -1.3% (Δ 3.7 pp).”
     - 2008–2010 crisis callout (anchored to the 2009 Spain bar): “Post‑2008 shock: Spain’s deficit peaks at -11.2% in 2009 vs EZ -6.3% — a divergence of 4.9 percentage points.”
     - 2011 adjustment callout (anchored to 2011 Spain bar): “2011: Spain still worse than the Zone (Spain -8.9% vs EZ -4.1%).”
     - 2012–2014 target callout (anchored to the last three Spain bars, grouped): “2012–2014 are government targets (not actuals). Euro‑Zone average data are unavailable for these years (NA).”
   - Style: short bold header line (e.g., “Post‑2008 shock:”) followed by 1–2 explanatory lines; annotation font ~14–16 pt so it is readable in presentation.
   - Justification: Annotation loading = 0.65 and WordCountAnnotation loading = 0.65 (both strongly positive). The model favors annotations and higher annotation word count relative to title, so add anchored, slightly longer explanatory notes inside the chart rather than in the title/subtitle.

6. Source note (de-emphasized)
   - Text: small, light, lower-left corner: “Data: provided dataset” (or specific source if required)
   - Font size: small (8–10 pt) and muted.
   - Justification: Government loading = -0.55 (strong negative). Avoid heavy governmental branding or prominent official-styled citations; keep source subtle.

Visual styling (colors, highlights, lines, patterns, and how missing/target data are shown)
1. Color scheme (data-encoding, not decorative)
   - Spain: warm, high-contrast color (deep burnt orange / crimson), used consistently for Spain bars.
   - Euro‑Zone average: cool muted blue-gray.
   - Use color purposefully (Style loading = -0.21 mildly negative — so avoid decorative palettes; choose colors for clear differentiation and accessibility).
   - Justification: Distinct colors improve immediate visual separation of the two series and make differences pop.

2. Actual vs target encoding (for 2012–2014 Spain)
   - For Spain 2012–2014 (targets), keep the Spain hue but apply a diagonal hatch and 50% opacity overlay on top of the solid fill, and a thin dark outline.
   - Add the inline key and the annotation that explains these years are targets.
   - For Euro‑Zone in 2012–2014 show no bar (data NA). Instead, leave space and optionally render a thin, light gray “no data” marker line across those years (or small “—” label at x-axis).
   - Justification: ReplaceMappings (0.33) supports an unconventional mapping to indicate “target” (hatching). The NA handling visually separates actual missing data from a 0 value.

3. Value axis and grid
   - Y-axis range: from -12.5% to +3% (covers the worst value -11.2 comfortably and gives space for labels).
   - Zero line emphasized: stronger horizontal line at y=0 for quick reference.
   - Light, thin horizontal gridlines at every 2 percentage points to aid reading values without clutter.
   - Axis labels: percent sign on y-axis label “% of GDP” placed vertically, font ~14–16 pt.
   - Tick labels: ~12–14 pt for presentations.
   - Justification: IdentifyValues and Annotation loadings increase emphasis on clear numeric reading; grid and emphasized zero line help viewers interpret sign and magnitude.

4. Direct labeling instead of legend
   - As above, label series directly on the chart near their bars. If needed, small swatches near the top-right to explain hatch = “target”.
   - Justification: ReplaceMappings 0.33 and IdentifyValues 0.53 favor direct, in-place mappings that reduce cognitive load.

5. Callout connector lines (lightweight)
   - For each annotation use a thin, neutral gray connector line from the annotation box to the bar tip; line weight small (0.8–1 px) and subtle.
   - No heavy arrows; only a minimal stem so the annotation is clearly anchored.
   - Justification: Lines loading = 0.25 (weak–moderate). Lightweight connector lines are permitted but should be unobtrusive because the loading isn’t strong.

6. Value label styling for legibility
   - Positive bars: label placed just above the bar tip in dark text if background is light.
   - Negative bars: label placed just below the tip inside the bar if the bar is dark; otherwise outside with contrasting text color.
   - For small bars, use outside placement with a thin leader if necessary to avoid overlap.
   - Ensure labels are sufficiently large (12–14 pt) and high contrast for presentation readability.
   - Justification: IdentifyValues 0.53 requires clear value labels; these placement rules prevent occlusion.

Composition and hierarchy (how visual attention is guided)
- Primary visual focus: the paired bars and numeric labels across years (because the analysis goal is to compare differences).
- Secondary focus: annotations that explain key divergence periods (anchored and worded to be a bit longer than title, in line with WordCountAnnotation 0.65).
- Title and subtitle minimal so they don’t compete with chart content (WordCountTitle -0.63).
- Source and other metadata minimized and de‑emphasized (Government -0.55).

Specific annotation text examples (use verbatim as callouts)
- 2006 callout (anchor to 2006 Spain bar): “Mid‑2000s: Spain posts a surplus (2006: +2.4%) while the Euro‑Zone average remains negative (-1.3%).”
- 2009 callout (anchor to 2009 Spain bar): “2009 peak deficit: Spain -11.2% vs EZ average -6.3% (Δ -4.9 pp).”
- 2011 callout (anchor to 2011 Spain bar): “2011: Spain remains deeper in deficit (-8.9%) than the Euro‑Zone (-4.1%).”
- 2012–2014 callout (group anchor to these Spain bars): “2012–2014 shown as government targets (not actuals). Euro‑Zone average data are unavailable (NA) for these years.”

Accessibility and presentation sizing
- Choose high-contrast color pair and ensure colorblind-friendly variant (e.g., deep orange vs slate blue).
- Font sizes for presentation: title 24–28 pt, subtitle 14–16 pt, axis labels 14–16 pt, tick labels 12–14 pt, annotation text 14–16 pt, value labels 12–14 pt.
- Maintain clear spacing between grouped bars—use compact grouping but with enough gutter so annotations and labels do not overlap.

How each major design decision ties to loadings (explicit)
- Emphasize annotations (Annotation = 0.65; WordCountAnnotation = 0.65): add multiple anchored callouts with 1–2 lines of explanatory text per callout. This increases in-chart explanatory text rather than a verbose title.
- Label all values (IdentifyValues = 0.53): numeric labels on every bar to make precise comparisons immediate.
- Short title, minimal subtitle (WordCountTitle = -0.63; Subtitle = 0.24): keep title extremely compact; put the explanatory load into annotations (consistent with high annotation loading and negative title loading).
- Replace legend with direct labels and small inline key (ReplaceMappings = 0.33): map colors and hatch directly in-chart to speed comprehension.
- Avoid government styling or prominent official branding (Government = -0.55): keep the visual tone neutral/journalistic rather than formal official report branding.
- Use lightweight connector lines only (Lines = 0.25): include subtle connector lines from annotation boxes to bar tips — unobtrusive because line loading is only moderate.
- Use color to encode meaning (Style slightly negative = -0.21): do not use decorative color for branding; instead use color to encode “Spain vs Euro‑Zone” and hatch to encode “target”.

Data-handling specifics to implement
- Render no Euro‑Zone bar for years 2012–2014 (NA). Leave the slot blank but maintain the x‑axis tick. Optionally mark the x-axis tick with a small “NA”.
- For Spain 2012–2014 render hatched bars with annotation “target”.
- Y-axis ticks at -12, -10, -8, -6, -4, -2, 0, +2 for simple reading.

Final note on emphasis
- The visual hierarchy (paired bars + numeric labels + anchored annotations) ensures year-to-year and Spain-vs-EuroZone differences are immediately legible and explained with contextual notes inside the plot — directly following the factor loadings that strongly favor annotations and explicit value identification while discouraging long titles and government-styled framing.
