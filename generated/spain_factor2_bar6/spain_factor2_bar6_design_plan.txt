Chart type and overall layout
- Chart type: Paired (grouped) vertical bar chart by year, two bars per year (Spain, Euro‑Zone average). This directly supports year-to-year visual comparison.
- Aspect ratio and orientation: Portrait, at least 3:4 (e.g., 900 px wide × 1200 px tall or 7.5" × 10" for print). Taller layout gives room for larger vertical bars, prominent annotations, and large text for presentations.
- Canvas margins: generous top margin for a short title and minimal subtitle; left margin for numeric axis labels; right margin for annotations anchored to bars.

Rationale tied to loadings:
- Focus on temporal paired bars aligns with the user’s requested emphasis on differences. The portrait aspect preserves bar height and legibility for presentation screens (no loading needed).

Axes, scale, and grid
- Y axis: linear scale with clear ticks at integers or half-integers covering the full range (e.g., -12 to +3). Show faint, thin horizontal gridlines only at major ticks to aid value reading.
- X axis: discrete years (1999–2014). Use large year labels rotated 0° (horizontal) and spaced for legibility. If space tight, show every other year and include small tick markers for intermediate years.
- Unit label: small, concise unit placed once near the Y axis: “Balance (% of GDP)”. Keep this short because WordCountTitle loading is strongly negative.

Rationale tied to loadings:
- ReplaceMappings (0.33) and IdentifyValues (0.53) — rely more on direct labeling of bars than on an explanatory long axis legend; keep axis labels minimal but clear. Keeping the unit concise addresses WordCountTitle negative loading (-0.63).

Bars and color treatment
- Two-color, functional palette: Spain = medium blue (colorblind-safe), Euro‑Zone average = medium warm gray or orange‑brown (contrast vs blue). Use only colors that encode data distinctions, not decoration.
- No decorative styling: flat fills, 1–2 px subtle stroke in a neutral gray to separate bars.
- Bar order: within each year, place Spain on the left, Euro‑Zone on the right to make Spain-first comparisons consistent across years.
- Group spacing: modest group padding so each year appears as a clear pair.

Rationale tied to loadings:
- Style negative loading (-0.21) — avoid decorative/brand colors; color is strictly functional. News (0.46) — clear high-contrast colors reminiscent of journalistic clarity.

Direct labeling and legend choices
- Omit a traditional legend. Use direct labels:
  - Place a large numeric value label (e.g., “-11.2”) centered just above each bar for positive bars and centered just below the top edge (or inside) for negative bars, with a short “%” suppressed since unit is presented once.
  - Add micro series label near the top of the first bar pair only: a small colored square + “Spain” and another + “Euro‑Zone avg.” placed discretely in the upper-right corner if needed for unfamiliar audiences.
- Use large, high-contrast sans-serif type (e.g., 20–28 pt for data labels on a slide) to ensure readability from the back of a room.

Rationale tied to loadings:
- IdentifyValues (0.53) — explicitly label all data points to serve as direct reference. ReplaceMappings (0.33) — direct labeling replaces reliance on a legend or complex axis decoding.

Title, subtitle, and text structure
- Title (short, minimal prominence): one-line title, small-to-moderate weight, e.g., “Budget balance: Spain vs Euro‑Zone (1999–2014)”. Keep it short and concise to respect WordCountTitle negative loading (-0.63) and the slightly negative Title loading (-0.25).
- Subtitle (very short, optional): one-line clarifier in smaller text under the title: “Balance as % of GDP — positive = surplus, negative = deficit.” This is the only place to explain sign meaning to support interpretation (CompareMappings loading 0.26).
- Body text (annotations, data labels) should be larger than the title word count: increase annotation word budget (see annotations below), following WordCountAnnotation (0.65) and Annotation (0.65).

Rationale tied to loadings:
- WordCountAnnotation and Annotation strongly positive (0.65 each) — allocate more text budget to short, targeted annotations rather than a long title. Title size and word count should be reduced (WordCountTitle -0.63).

Annotations and callouts (primary emphasis)
- Include anchored, short annotations at 4–6 key years to highlight the most relevant differences and turning points:
  - 2004–2007 (Spain surplus years): small callout pointing to 2006 bar: “Spain posts surplus (+2.4) while Euro average ≈ +1.1.”
  - 2008–2011 (crisis years): highlight 2009 and 2010 with short annotation and subtle bounding halo: “2009–10: Spain’s deficit far exceeds Euro average (–11.2 vs –6.3).”
  - 2014: small note on partial recovery: “2014: gap narrowed (Spain –2.5, Euro –2.0).”
- Annotation style: short phrase (6–12 words), bolded numeric values, anchored to target bars with thin connecting lines (1 px) and a small rounded speech-box or soft halo around the text. Keep annotations compact and placed to minimize overlap with bars and labels; use arrows/lines only when necessary to clarify which bar.
- Keep total annotation word count intentionally higher than title word count (concise but explanatory), in line with WordCountAnnotation positive loading.

Rationale tied to loadings:
- Annotation (0.65) and WordCountAnnotation (0.65) — prioritize short, anchored annotations that help the audience immediately interpret key differences. Lines (0.25) — use subtle connector lines for clarity, not heavy callouts. CompareMappings (0.26) — use brief interpretive phrasing to translate numbers (e.g., "exceeds", "narrowed").

Emphasis and highlighting of differences
- Visual emphasis: for the single largest divergence (2009 Spain –11.2 vs Euro –6.3), add a subtle translucent highlight behind that year’s pair (soft warm tint or slightly darker background band) and an annotation callout. Similarly, for the largest positive Spain surplus in 2006, add a small halo.
- Do not overuse highlights — limit to the top 2–3 most informative years to preserve visual hierarchy.

Rationale tied to loadings:
- Annotation (0.65) and IdentifyValues (0.53) support these targeted highlights. ReplaceMappings (0.33) supports using visual cues instead of verbose legends. This focuses the viewer on differences without decorative excess (Style -0.21).

Minimizing unwanted signals (government styling, decorative branding)
- Avoid government seals, formal heraldic colors, or excessively formal typography; choose neutral journalistic typography (e.g., Helvetica/Arial or similar).
- Avoid heavy top banners, ornamental borders, or long descriptive paragraphs.

Rationale tied to loadings:
- Government source negative loading (-0.55) — do not evoke official-government visual tropes. Style negative (-0.21) — avoid purely decorative elements.

Tone and wording
- Use factual, concise phrasing in annotations (mildly interpretive is okay due to PresentValenced Subtext 0.22, but keep it restrained). Example annotation text: “2009: Spain deficit –11.2 (Euro avg –6.3) — peak divergence.”
- Keep explanatory text neutral and numeric-first: lead with the number, then short interpretation.

Rationale tied to loadings:
- News positive (0.46) — adopt concise, clear, slightly journalistic language. PresentValenced Subtext is small positive (0.22) — allow mild interpretation but avoid emotionally loaded language.

Accessibility and presentation specs
- Typography: sans-serif, high-contrast. Suggested sizes for a slide:
  - Title: 28–32 pt (short)
  - Subtitle: 18–20 pt
  - Axis labels and years: 18–20 pt
  - Data value labels: 20–24 pt (large enough to read in a presentation)
  - Annotation text: 18–22 pt (visible and slightly larger word budget than title)
- Colors: colorblind-safe palette (e.g., ColorBrewer recommendations). Check contrast ratios to meet accessibility standards.
- Export: provide a high-resolution (300 dpi) PDF/PNG for slides.

Rationale tied to loadings:
- IdentifyValues and Annotation loadings require text to be easily readable; large font sizes improve legibility in presentation contexts.

Summary of mapping loadings to concrete design decisions
- Annotation (0.65) & WordCountAnnotation (0.65): include multiple anchored short annotations; allocate more words to annotations than the title; use thin connector lines.
- IdentifyValues (0.53): label each bar with its numeric value (large, high-contrast).
- ReplaceMappings (0.33): prefer direct labeling over a traditional legend; include a very short unit label instead of verbose axes explanation.
- News (0.46): adopt a clear, journalistic visual language—high contrast, simple colors, concise text.
- Government (-0.55) & Style (-0.21): avoid government branding and decorative color use; keep style functional.
- WordCountTitle (-0.63) & Title (-0.25): keep title short and modest in prominence; let annotations carry interpretation.
- Lines (0.25): use only thin, subtle connector lines for annotation anchoring.
- CompareMappings (0.26) & Subtitle (0.24): include a one-line subtitle to clarify sign meaning and frame comparisons.

Concrete layout example (for implementation)
- Canvas: 900 × 1200 px.
- Top: Title line (centered, 28–32 pt). Underneath: one-line subtitle (18–20 pt).
- Main plotting area: centered vertical bar region occupying approx. 80% of canvas height.
- Bars: grouped by year, left bar = Spain (blue), right bar = Euro (gray). Numeric label for each bar in 20–24 pt.
- Annotations: 3–4 callouts placed around 2006, 2009–2010 cluster, 2014; thin 1 px connector lines, small rounded annotation boxes ~18–20 pt.
- Right-upper corner: tiny direct color key only if needed (small squares + labels), otherwise rely on locally placed series labels at top of the first pair.

This plan will emphasize the differences between Spain and the Euro‑Zone average, maximize immediate numeric readability (IdentifyValues), and use abundant, short anchored annotations (Annotation / WordCountAnnotation) to explain the most salient divergences, while keeping the title short and avoiding decorative or government-style elements.
