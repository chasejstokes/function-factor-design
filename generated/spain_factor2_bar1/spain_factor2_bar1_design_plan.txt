Chart type and layout
- Paired vertical bar chart (Spain and Euro‑Zone average as paired bars for each year) arranged along the x‑axis (years 1999–2014). Bars extend upward for surpluses and downward for deficits with a zero baseline.
- Aspect ratio: portrait orientation at least 3:4 (example recommendation: 900 px wide × 1200 px tall or a 3:4 print/poster proportion). Taller layout gives room for stacked annotations and large readable text as requested.

Reasoning: preserves the user request for a paired bar chart and a taller canvas for large text and multiple annotations (Annotation and WordCountAnnotation loadings high: 0.65 each — emphasize integrated annotations and richer annotation word content).

Data grouping and pair ordering
- For each year show two adjacent bars: left = Spain, right = Euro‑Zone average.
- For years 2012–2014, draw Spain bars normally but mark them as targets (see “Target styling” below). For Euro‑Zone 2012–2014 show an explicit "N/A" slot (no bar), see “Missing data” below.

Reasoning: user focus is differences between Spain and Euro‑Zone; paired bars make differences visually comparable.

Color, patterns, and decorative use
- Use functional, colorblind‑safe palette (color use is functional, not decorative, because Style loading is negative: -0.21). Suggested colors: Spain = dark blue (#0B5FFF), Euro‑Zone = dark teal (#028F88). Use hues that contrast strongly against background and each other.
- Avoid decorative brand colors or heavy styling. Keep fills solid and high-contrast for clarity.

Reasoning: Style negative means avoid purely decorative color choices; choose colors that communicate categories clearly and accessibly.

Target years (2012–2014) styling
- Spain target bars: same Spain color but 50% opacity plus a subtle diagonal hatch (thin 45° lines) and a small, inline text label above each target bar: "Target (not actual)".
- Do not emphasize as actual observed data; visually distinct so viewers immediately know these are projected/target values.

Reasoning: The dataset note that final 3 years are targets should be visible. Annotation and WordCountAnnotation high favor including short inline text that explains targets. This preserves data integrity and avoids misleading readers.

Missing Euro‑Zone values (2012–2014)
- For Euro‑Zone in 2012–2014 show an unobtrusive placeholder: a very light gray, thin dashed outline box centered in the paired slot with "N/A" centered in the box (same font family, medium size). No bar fill.
- Add a short annotation pointing to the N/A placeholder: "Euro‑Zone avg unavailable" (see Annotations).

Reasoning: ReplaceMappings loading (0.33) supports replacing the conventional legend/omitted element with an inline mapping/placeholder that explains omitted data rather than leaving empty space.

Direct labeling and legend replacement
- Omit a separate legend. Instead, apply direct labels:
  - At the top of the first year pair, place two small, high‑contrast color chips with text "Spain" and "Euro‑Zone avg" (or simply label each bar pair directly with a color chip and label on the first pair).
  - Additionally, every bar has a value label placed just above (for positive) or just below (for negative) the bar tip: e.g., "-11.2%".
- Keep these labels large and bold for presentation readability.

Reasoning: IdentifyValues has a strong positive loading (0.53) — label every data point. ReplaceMappings suggests preferring inline/embedded mappings over separate legends (0.33). This both improves readability and reduces eye movement.

Title, subtitle, and text structure
- Title (very short, minimal words — WordCountTitle loading strongly negative: -0.63): one line, large: "Budget balance: Spain vs Euro‑Zone".
- Subtitle (optional, short, small): one short line under the title: "Percent of GDP, 1999–2014" — keep subtitle concise (Subtitle loading 0.24 is mildly positive, but WordCountTitle negative pushes wordiness down).
- Footnote / data note (medium text, larger than typical footnotes because Annotation/WordCountAnnotation is high): a short block at bottom left or bottom center (slightly larger than typical footnote): "Note: 2012–2014 are Spain’s stated targets (not observed values). Euro‑Zone average unavailable for 2012–2014 (NA). Data compiled from news/aggregate reporting."
  - Phrase “news/aggregate reporting” rather than heavy government branding, because Government loading is strongly negative (-0.55) but News loading is positive (0.46).

Reasoning: Strong negative WordCountTitle means the title must be short; Annotation and WordCountAnnotation high means explanatory words should live in annotations/footnote rather than the title. Government negative suggests avoid prominent government labeling; News positive supports a concise source label referencing aggregated reporting.

Annotations (anchored short-form text)
- Add 3–4 anchored annotations (Annotation loading 0.65 high), each 8–18 words (higher annotation word ratio consistent with WordCountAnnotation 0.65):
  1. 2005–2007 (above 2006 Spain bar): "Spain posts sustained surpluses while Euro‑Zone remains in deficit."
  2. 2008–2009 (callout near 2009 pair): "Crisis peak: Spain deeper deficit (-11.2%) vs EZ avg (-6.3%)."
  3. 2010–2011 (near 2011 bars): "Persistent deficits in recovery years."
  4. 2012–2014 (near target bars): "2012–2014: Spain targets, not actuals."
- Use short, neutral factual phrasing (avoid value‑laden language; PresentValenced Subtext loading modestly positive 0.22 — keep tone neutral).
- Use thin connector lines (Lines loading 0.25 modestly positive supports use of minimal connectors) from annotation text boxes to the associated bars; connectors should be light gray, 1 px, rounded ends, non‑intrusive.

Reasoning: High Annotation and WordCountAnnotation loadings justify multiple short anchored explanations that interpret key differences and context. Using connector lines is supported but keep them lightweight so they help without clutter.

Value labels and numeric formatting
- Show numeric labels for every bar as percentage with one decimal and a percent sign (e.g., "-11.2%"). Labels should be bold, high contrast, and sized for presentation (recommend 14–18 pt depending on final output).
- Position labels outside bar ends (above for positive, below for negative) with a thin halo or white stroke to ensure legibility when overlapping gridlines or bars.

Reasoning: IdentifyValues high (0.53) — readers should be able to read each data value directly. This reduces cognitive overhead in comparing exact numbers.

Axis, gridlines, and scale
- Y‑axis labeled "Percent of GDP" with tick marks perhaps every 2% from -12% to +3% (scale chosen to comfortably include -11.2 and +2.4).
- Place horizontal gridlines only (light gray, 10–15% opacity) for easy horizontal comparison; omit vertical gridlines to reduce noise.
- Ensure zero baseline is visually emphasized (slightly thicker line) so surpluses vs deficits are immediately clear.

Reasoning: Clear axis and gridlines help viewers compare absolute and relative differences. Minimal grid usage aligns with the preference for functional clarity (Style negative).

Typography, sizing, and contrast (presentation legibility)
- Typeface: clean, high‑legibility sans serif (e.g., Inter, Helvetica Neue, or Roboto).
- Title size: large for presentations (approx. 28–36 pt).
- Subtitle: ~18–22 pt.
- Axis labels and tick labels: ~16–20 pt.
- Bar value labels: ~14–18 pt.
- Annotation text boxes: ~16–18 pt (annotations intentionally larger than typical footnotes, reflecting WordCountAnnotation loading).
- Footnote/source: ~12–14 pt but readable from presentation distance.
- High contrast between text and background; background should be white or very light gray.

Reasoning: User explicitly asked that text be large enough for presentation. The factor structure emphasizes more words in annotations and fewer in title, so annotation sizes are relatively large.

Minimal decorative elements and branding
- Do not add government seals, heavy branding, or decorative borders (Government loading strongly negative: -0.55 and Style negative). If an organizational logo is required, place a tiny, unobtrusive logo in a corner and keep it visually small.
- Keep overall styling functional and data‑centric.

Reasoning: Government negative means avoid emphasizing government origin; Style negative discourages decorative flourishes.

Interaction/export guidance (static or slide)
- For slide use: export at high resolution (300 dpi in chosen aspect ratio) so large type remains sharp.
- If interactive is possible: hover tooltips should repeat the value label and the annotation text for that year pair; but still show values by default per IdentifyValues loading.

Reasoning: Maintaining readable labels and annotations in both static and interactive contexts supports the emphasis on IdentifyValues and Annotation.

How each major design choice ties to the loadings (brief)
- Heavy use of anchored annotations and larger annotation word count — driven by Annotation (0.65) and WordCountAnnotation (0.65).
- Label every bar with numeric values — driven by IdentifyValues (0.53).
- Replace separate legend with inline labels and placeholders for missing data — ReplaceMappings (0.33) supports mapping replacements and explicit N/A placeholders.
- Avoid government branding and minimize government source callouts — Government negative (-0.55).
- Keep title very short — WordCountTitle strongly negative (-0.63).
- Use neutral, factual annotation language; avoid emotional tone — PresentValenced Subtext modest (0.22), prefer neutral phrasing.
- Use minimal connector lines from annotations to elements — Lines modestly positive (0.25) supports light use only.
- Include a short source line referencing news/aggregated reporting rather than a government seal — News positive (0.46) but keep it terse and low‑prominence.

Concrete annotation texts (copy to use)
- Title: "Budget balance: Spain vs Euro‑Zone"
- Subtitle: "Percent of GDP, 1999–2014"
- Annotations:
  - 2006 (near Spain surplus): "2005–2007: Spain posts surpluses while Euro‑Zone averages remain negative."
  - 2009 (callout): "2009 peak: Spain −11.2% vs Euro‑Zone −6.3%."
  - 2011 (callout): "2010–2011: deep deficits persist during recovery."
  - 2012–2014 (near targets): "2012–2014: Spain targets (not observed)."
- Footnote: "Note: 2012–2014 are Spain’s targets. Euro‑Zone average unavailable 2012–2014 (NA). Data compiled from aggregated reporting."

Final visual checklist before export
- Canvas in 3:4 or taller portrait ratio, adequate margins for annotations.
- Paired bars per year with Spain left / Euro‑Zone right.
- Distinct, functional colors; direct labels; value labels on every bar.
- Target bars hatched and semi‑transparent; Euro‑Zone N/A placeholders shown.
- 3–4 anchored annotations with light connector lines.
- Short title, short subtitle, slightly larger footnote explaining targets/missing data.
- Fonts and sizes set for presentation legibility; high-contrast layout; minimal decoration.

This plan aligns the visualization with the factor loadings by prioritizing annotations and explicit value labeling, minimizing title length and government branding, and replacing a separate legend with inline mappings and clear placeholders for missing data.
