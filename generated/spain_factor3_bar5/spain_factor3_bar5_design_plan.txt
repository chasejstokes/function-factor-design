Design plan — Paired bar chart (portrait; at least 3:4)

Chart type
- Paired vertical bar chart (grouped bars) by year (x-axis) with two series: Spain and Euro‑Zone Average. Bars extend above/below a emphasized zero line to show surplus vs deficit.
- Aspect ratio: portrait, minimum 3:4 (e.g., 900 px wide × 1200 px tall) to satisfy “taller than wide” and to allow large text and clear annotations.

Reasoning: a grouped bar chart directly supports year-by-year comparison (CompareValues loading = 0.45) and makes visual differences between Spain and the Euro‑Zone average immediately readable.

Layout and axes
- X-axis: years 1999–2014, vertical ordering left-to-right, generous horizontal spacing so each year pair has room for labels and callouts.
- Y-axis: Budget balance (% of GDP), tick marks every 2.5 or 5 percentage points depending on range; include an emphasized zero baseline (thicker, darker line) so surpluses and deficits are visually distinct.
- Gridlines: very light horizontal gridlines for readability; no vertical gridlines.
- Missing data (Euro‑Zone average for 2012–2014): leave no bar for Euro‑Zone; place a light grey “no data” symbol (small hollow circle with a short dashed connector) next to those year ticks with a brief note in the footnote. Spain’s 2012–2014 bars are rendered as “targets” (see visual treatment below).

Text structure (large, presentation-friendly sizes)
- Title (top, centered-left): short and specific — “Budget balance: Spain vs Euro‑Zone average (1999–2014)”. Font size: ~28–34 pt.
  - Tied to WordCountSubtitle negative loading (-0.30): keep title concise and avoid a long subtitle.
- Subtitle (optional, very short, directly beneath title): one short sentence — “Final three years are Spain’s official targets (not actual outcomes).” Font size: ~18–20 pt; if space tight, move this sentence into the source/footnote line instead.
  - Reasoning: WordCountSubtitle is negatively loaded → minimize subtitle length while still flagging targets.
- Legend (top-right, compact): two entries with small icon: Spain (deep red rectangle + small Spain flag icon) and Euro‑Zone (muted blue rectangle + small euro symbol icon). Font size: ~16–18 pt.
  - Icons loading 0.41 → use small pictorial symbols beside legend entries to reinforce category meaning without clutter.
- Axis labels: Y-axis label “Budget balance (% of GDP)” — 18–20 pt. X-axis year labels — 16–18 pt, rotated slightly if needed for spacing.
- Data value labels: show numeric labels above/below each bar for major years (see CompareValues emphasis) in 14–16 pt. For the many bars, show values for all bars is optional; prioritize showing values for highlighted comparison years and allow smaller tick labels for others.
  - IdentifyValues has modest loading (0.22) but CompareValues is strong (0.45) → emphasize value labeling selectively to support direct comparisons rather than labeling every bar by default.
- Footnote/metadata (bottom left, smaller but legible): “Source: [Government agency]. Spain 2012–2014 are government targets; Euro‑Zone averages not available for 2012–2014.” Font size ~12–14 pt.
  - Logos 0.52 and Government 0.43 → include a small government logo (bottom-right) next to the source line for official branding and trust. PresentMetadata loading (0.22) supports a concise source note.

Visual styling and color
- Overall style: polished, slightly branded/decorative color palette but with clear data encoding (Style loading = 0.56). Use tasteful aesthetics that do not obscure data.
- Colors:
  - Spain: deep Iberian red (saturated, e.g., #C62828).
  - Euro‑Zone average: muted blue-gray (e.g., #4A90A4 desaturated).
  - “Targets” (Spain 2012–2014): same red hue but rendered as hatched fill or 60% opacity with a diagonal hatch pattern and thin outline to indicate “target” vs realized data.
  - Missing Euro‑Zone: no bar; use a small desaturated grey “no data” indicator (light hollow circle icon) above the x-axis tick.
- Background: off-white or very light neutral to improve contrast in a presentation; subtle panel shadow around plotting area for depth (decorative but restrained).
- Zero line and algorithmic baseline: thicker, dark neutral line to anchor surplus vs deficit.

Emphasis and annotations (use because Annotation loading = 0.32, Circles = 0.31, Lines = 0.30)
- Highlight key comparisons with lightweight callouts:
  - 2005–2007: annotate that Spain had consecutive surpluses while Euro‑Zone remained in deficit. Place a small circular highlight around the Spain 2006 bar top with a short callout: “Spain +2.4 pp (2006) vs EZ −1.3 pp” with a thin connector line. Use a small positive icon (upwards caret or flag) next to the callout.
  - 2009 (peak deficit): circle Spain 2009 bar top, draw a thin arrow/line to a short annotation: “2009: Spain −11.2% vs EZ −6.3% → Spain −4.9 pp larger deficit”. Display the numeric difference explicitly (SummarizeValues loading = 0.36).
  - 2010–2011: annotate that Spain’s deficits remain substantially larger than EZ, with a small boxed summary near the center: “Crisis years: Spain persistently worse than EZ average (2008–2011)”.
- Use small hollow circles on bar tops for each annotated year (Circles loading = 0.31) to anchor the callouts visually. Connector lines should be thin, neutral gray (Lines loading = 0.30) and end in a small arrowhead pointing to the circle.
- Keep annotations short (one line each); place them to avoid overlapping bars. Use a slightly semi-transparent light background box for each annotation so it remains legible against bars.

Compare-focused elements (CompareValues loading = 0.45)
- Add an optional small “difference” label for the most informative years (e.g., 2006, 2009, 2011): display the difference in percentage points between Spain and Euro‑Zone, e.g., “Δ = −4.9 pp” positioned near the year. Keep these labels subtle (14–16 pt) and in a neutral color.
- If space permits, add a thin dotted connector linking the two bars for a year when the difference is being highlighted to reinforce comparison.

Branding and source (Logos 0.52; Government 0.43)
- Place a small government logo (square, 40–60 px) bottom-right near the source line. Use brand colors subtly elsewhere (title or accent) to make the chart feel official (Style loading = 0.56).
- Source line: concise — “Source: [Agency name], official statistics.” Keep the source legible and short (12–14 pt).

Handling missing data and targets (PresentContext loading = 0.32; SummarizeValues = 0.36)
- For 2012–2014:
  - Spain bars show targets with hatched pattern and a short inline label “target” (e.g., “2014: −2.8 (target)”). Use a small flag icon next to label (Icons loading = 0.41).
  - Euro‑Zone average: explicitly show “no data” — small dash or hollow grey circle above the x-axis tick with tooltip/footnote that average is unavailable for those years.
- Add a small contextual sentence in the footnote: “Final three years are Spain government targets; Euro‑Zone averages not reported for 2012–2014.” This respects PresentContext loading and clarifies interpretation.

Text and typographic scale (presentation-ready)
- Title: 28–34 pt
- Subtitle/one-line contextual note: 18–20 pt
- Axis label (Y): 18–20 pt
- Year labels and legend: 16–18 pt
- Annotation and callout text: 16–18 pt (bold key numbers)
- Data value labels and difference labels: 14–16 pt
- Footnote/source: 12–14 pt
Reasoning: keep sizes large for presentation viewing while keeping hierarchy clear.

Minimal decorative elements (because Style loading high but keep readability)
- Use tasteful decorative touches: slight drop-shadow under bars, rounded bar corners (small radius), and a thin border around the plotting panel. Do not add heavy ornamentation that confuses the data reading.
- Decorative color palette should remain consistent and not encode additional variables.

Interactivity/alternate outputs (if applicable)
- For interactive or slide versions: hover states that reveal exact values and the computed difference for each year; clicking on a year expands a small side panel with the contextual note. (Optional, but aligns with CompareValues and PresentMetadata loadings.)

How each major design choice maps to the provided loadings
- Emphasize direct point-to-point comparisons (CompareValues = 0.45): paired bars per year, numeric difference labels for key years, dotted connectors for highlighted comparisons.
- Official branding and source prominence (Logos = 0.52; Government = 0.43): small government logo and concise source line; slightly branded color accents to convey authority.
- Decorative styling (Style = 0.56): tasteful branded palette, rounded bars, and subtle depth effects to make the slide visually appealing while keeping data encoding clear.
- Annotations and callouts (Annotation = 0.32; Circles = 0.31; Lines = 0.30): short, anchored annotations with small circular highlights and thin connector lines for emphasis on critical comparisons (2006 surplus vs 2009 deficit).
- Icons (Icons = 0.41): small flag/euro icons in the legend and small icons for “target” and “no data” markers to increase quick recognition.
- Summarize values and context (SummarizeValues = 0.36; PresentContext = 0.32): a short boxed summary for the crisis period and a clear footnote explaining the final three target years and missing EZ averages.
- Keep subtitle short (WordCountSubtitle = -0.30) and shift explanatory detail to concise annotations and footnotes; allow total text content to remain moderate but purposeful (WordCountTotal = 0.54 — prefer multiple short textual elements rather than a single long paragraph).
- Minimal paragraph body (Paragraph loading = 0.26; PresentMetadata/IdentifyValues modest): avoid long body text; include a concise metadata footnote and selectively displayed value labels rather than full paragraphs.

Deliverable notes for production
- Use high-contrast colors for accessibility; ensure bars meet contrast ratio guidelines against the background.
- Export at presentation resolution (e.g., 1920×2560 or vector PDF for crisp scaling).
- Provide separate color/hatch treatment layers so “targets” can be toggled or annotated in slides.
- Ensure final figure includes the small government logo, short source line, and the one-line note about targets.
