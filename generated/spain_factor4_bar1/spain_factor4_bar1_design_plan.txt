Chart type and overall layout
- Chart: Paired vertical bar chart (two bars per year: Spain vs Euro-zone average), baseline at 0 so surpluses extend upward and deficits downward. Years on the x-axis (1999–2014).  
- Aspect ratio & canvas: Portrait orientation, at least 3:4 (width:height = 3:4 or taller). Example canvas: 900 × 1200 px (or 6" × 8" at presentation resolution). This makes text and bars taller and easier to read in a presentation.

Rationale: Paired bars over time directly supports CompareValues (Loading = 0.58) by enabling side‑by‑side year-to-year comparison; portrait aspect (taller) suits negative/positive divergences and ensures large readable text (AxisAxes loading = 0.31).

Scale, grid, and axis treatment
- Y-axis: labeled "Fiscal balance (% of GDP)". Range from -12.5 to +3.5 (includes Spain's -11.2). Major ticks every 2.5 percentage points, minor ticks every 1 point. Horizontal light gridlines for each major tick.
- X-axis: Years shown every year but use slightly smaller tick labels for the dense axis; keep labels large enough for presentation (see typography below).
- Axis styling: Thick, high-contrast axis lines; major ticks and labels emphasized. Leave space above top bars for annotations.

Rationale: Strong, legible axes match AxisAxes (0.31) and help readers compare magnitudes visually (CompareValues 0.58). Gridlines support reading values without crowding bars.

Bars, pairing, and missing data / targets
- Pairing: For each year, two narrow side-by-side bars with small gap. Spain bar on the left of the pair, Euro-zone average on the right.
- Colors: Spain = warm/high-contrast accent (e.g., deep orange #d95f02); Euro-zone average = desaturated cool (medium gray-blue #6c7aa0). Both colors chosen for high contrast and colorblind distinguishability.
- Fill & pattern for target years: For 2012–2014 (Spain = government targets), use the same Spain accent color but with 30% opacity and diagonal hatch (thin lines) overlay. For Euro-zone average 2012–2014, show no bar and a faint vertical faint gray strip in the background with the label "EZ data unavailable".
- Missing-data handling: For 2012–2014 do not fabricate EZ bars. Instead show an unobtrusive shaded column (very light gray) behind the year labels and add a concise note in the footnote/legend: "Euro-zone average not reported 2012–2014."

Rationale: Differentiating target years visually and showing missing EZ data follows PresentContext (0.34) and avoids misleading comparisons. The hatch for targets signals "projection/target" clearly. Not showing EZ bars for 2012–2014 aligns with accurate presentation of available data (SummarizeValues 0.65).

Labeling and numeric labels
- Avoid labeling every bar (IdentifyValues loading = -0.28 => minimize full numeric labels). Instead:
  - Label only the most important values: Spain 2009 (-11.2), Euro-zone 2009 (-6.3) with a comparison annotation; Spain 2005–2007 surpluses annotated with combined one-line summary; Spain 2010–2011 notable deficits annotated as needed.
  - Y-axis tick labels and gridlines provide reading for other years.
  - Include a small legend with colored swatches: "Spain", "Euro-zone average", and "Spain targets".

Rationale: The negative loading on IdentifyValues suggests avoiding full-value clutter. Selective labeling focuses attention on comparisons (CompareValues 0.58) and keeps the visual clean and legible in a presentation.

Direct comparison callouts and synthesis
- Add 2–3 lightweight callouts (thin leader line + small rounded rectangle background or subtle arrowhead) focusing on:
  1) 2005–2007: short callout: "Surpluses in 2005–2007 (Spain > 0; EZ negative)".
  2) 2009 crisis peak: "2009: Spain −11.2% vs EZ −6.3% → gap 4.9 pp".
  3) 2012–2014: "2012–2014 are government targets — EZ data not reported".
- Place a compact synthesis box (top-right) with 2–3 short bullet sentences that summarize the pattern and the key numeric summaries (use bold for numbers). Example text (see Text Structure section for exact wording).

Rationale: SummarizeValues (0.65) and SummarizeConceptsSynthesis (0.71) are strongly positive — include a concise synthesis that computes and states the main aggregated insights. CompareValues (0.58) supports highlighting precise year-to-year gaps. Arrows had only moderate loading (0.21) so callouts should be lightweight (thin leaders rather than heavy arrows).

Text structure, content, and placement (large, presentation‑ready)
- Title (top center, largest): One-line, bold, large — 30–36 pt. Example: "Spain vs Euro‑Zone: Fiscal balance (% of GDP), 1999–2014".
  - Reason: AxisAxes (0.31) and the need to be readable in presentation.
- Subtitle (below title, multi-clause, longer than typical — WordCountSubtitle loading = 0.45; Subtitle loading = 0.38): 16–20 pt. Use a slightly valenced but factual sentence (PresentValenced Subtext = 0.7 and PresentContext = 0.34). Example subtitle (20–25 words): "Spain outperformed the euro‑zone average in the mid‑2000s, then plunged during the crisis; 2012–2014 show government targets, not reported EZ averages."
  - Reason: The positive loadings for Subtitle and WordCountSubtitle indicate including a substantive subtitle that orients the audience and conveys synthesis.
- Synthesis box (top-right of plot area, 14–16 pt): short computed bullets (SummarizeValues 0.65 & SummarizeConceptsSynthesis 0.71). Example items:
  - "Peak Spain deficit: −11.2% (2009)."
  - "Largest gap vs EZ: 4.9 percentage points (2009)."
  - "Spain ran small surpluses 2005–2007; subsequent deficits exceeded EZ where reported."
- Legend (top-left or below the title, 14–16 pt): small, clear with swatches and short labels. Include a small marker explaining hatch = targets and shaded column = EZ data unavailable.
- Footnote (bottom-left, 10–12 pt): "Notes: Euro‑zone averages not reported for 2012–2014. Spain 2012–2014 are government targets, not actual values. Source: [your source]."

Rationale: The strong loadings on SummarizeConceptsSynthesis and SummarizeValues require clear, text-based synthesis and computed numbers. The fairly high PresentValenced Subtext supports a slightly emotive framing in the subtitle (but keep it evidence-based). AxisAxes positivity also requires legible large text.

Annotation style and auxiliary visuals
- Keep callouts lightweight: thin 1–1.5 px leader lines, rounded rect callout boxes in very light neutral background with 1 px stroke. Use no heavy arrows; if needed, small unobtrusive arrowheads only for the 2009 gap callout.
- Use subtle shading to separate target years (vertical light hatch or light background strip).
- Use bolding and color emphasis in the synthesis box only for the numeric values (e.g., −11.2, 4.9 pp) to draw eyes to computed comparisons.

Rationale: Arrows have low-to-moderate loading (0.21) so keep arrows minimal. Auxiliary visuals are allowed only when supported by loadings (CompareValues and SummarizeValues support small comparison callouts).

Color, contrast and accessibility
- Ensure high contrast between bars and background; use a white or very light neutral background.
- Use colorblind‑safe pair: Spain (warm orange), Euro‑zone (muted blue/gray). Test for 3-color palette if needed for additional elements.
- Ensure annotation/background boxes use >4.5:1 contrast for legibility at distance.

Rationale: High legibility aligns with AxisAxes (0.31) and presentation needs; color choices support CompareValues by making Spain immediately identifiable.

Typography (presentation sizes)
- Title: 30–36 pt, bold.
- Subtitle: 16–20 pt, regular.
- Axis labels: 16–18 pt.
- Axis tick labels: 14–16 pt.
- Legend text: 14–16 pt.
- Annotations & synthesis box text: 14–16 pt.
- Footnote: 10–12 pt.

Rationale: Explicit large text sizes satisfy the user's request and align with AxisAxes emphasis.

Specific computed comparisons to include (exact numbers called out)
- Spain 2009: −11.2%; Euro-zone 2009: −6.3%; show computed gap = 4.9 percentage points (annotation).
- Spain 2005–2007: combined note that Spain was positive (1.3, 2.4, 1.9) while EZ average was negative — callout that Spain outperformed EZ in that period.
- Peak surplus and trough for Spain with short mention in synthesis.

Rationale: High loadings on CompareValues (0.58), SummarizeValues (0.65), and SummarizeConceptsSynthesis (0.71) require explicit numeric comparisons and short synthesis.

Avoidances and constraints (based on negative loadings)
- Do not label every single bar with its numeric value (IdentifyValues = -0.28).
- Do not adopt a social-media style layout (big emojis, pastel meme-style, large banner overlays) because SocialMedia loading = -0.34. Keep a professional data-visualization aesthetic.
- Avoid heavy decorative arrows or oversized callouts (Arrows loading = 0.21 low).

Rationale: Respecting negative loadings reduces clutter and preserves professional clarity.

Final composition checklist for production
- Canvas portrait 3:4 or taller (e.g., 900×1200 px).
- Paired vertical bars, baseline at 0, y-range -12.5 to +3.5.
- Spain color (deep orange) bars; Euro-zone color (muted blue/gray); hatch for target years.
- Axis labels and ticks large and high-contrast; light horizontal gridlines.
- Legend and a multi-sentence subtitle (substantive — ~20 words).
- Synthesis box with 2–3 computed bullets (peak deficit, largest gap, target note).
- 2–3 lightweight callouts highlighting comparisons (2005–2007 surpluses; 2009 gap; 2012–2014 targets).
- Footnote clarifying that 2012–2014 are targets and EZ averages are not reported for those years.

How these choices map to the loadings (brief mapping)
- CompareValues (0.58): Paired bars, selective numeric callouts, computed gap annotations to emphasize direct comparisons.
- SummarizeValues (0.65) & SummarizeConceptsSynthesis (0.71): Synthesis box with computed aggregates and short interpretation.
- PresentValenced Subtext (0.7): A slightly stronger, factual subtitle and one short sentence in the synthesis that acknowledges the crisis-era deterioration (kept evidence-based).
- AxisAxes (0.31): Emphasize large, legible axis and ticks for presentation readability.
- Subtitle (0.38) & WordCountSubtitle (0.45): Include a substantive subtitle (longer than typical) to give context and summarize the key pattern.
- PresentContext (0.34): Visual treatment for missing EZ data, and explicit contextual footnote explaining targets vs actuals.
- IdentifyValues (-0.28) & SocialMedia (-0.34): Avoid labeling every bar and avoid social‑media styling.

Deliverable-ready notes
- Provide numeric values for annotations (e.g., 2009 Spain −11.2%; EZ −6.3%; gap 4.9 pp).  
- Use the hatch/pattern layer for Spain 2012–2014 and annotate as “targets.”  
- Ensure final export at presentation resolution with fonts embedded for consistent display.
