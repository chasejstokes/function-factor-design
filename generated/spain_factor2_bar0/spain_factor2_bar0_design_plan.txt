Chart type
- Paired vertical bar chart (two bars per year: Spain vs Euro‑zone average), x-axis = year, y-axis = percent of GDP (surplus positive, deficit negative).
- Layout: portrait orientation, aspect ratio 3:4 (width:height = 3:4). Recommended canvas for presentation: 900 × 1200 px (or 9" × 12") so the chart is taller than wide and text can be large.

Reasoning: user requested a paired bar chart over time and a taller-than-wide layout. The portrait canvas gives space for stacked annotations and large text.

Text structure (content, position, and relative word counts)
1. Title (top, very short — 3–5 words)
   - Text: “Spain vs Euro‑Zone: Budget (% GDP)”
   - Rationale: WordCountTitle has a strong negative loading (-0.63). Keep the title terse to satisfy the loading and avoid heavy title text that would compete with annotations. Title font: large, bold (approx. 36–48 pt depending on canvas).

2. Subtitle (below title, single short sentence — slightly longer than title but still concise)
   - Text: “Annual budget surplus/deficit, 1999–2014 (last 3 years = Spain targets)”
   - Rationale: Subtitle loading is slightly positive (0.24). Use a short explanatory subtitle to orient viewers to the timeframe and to explicitly flag the final three years as targets. Subtitle font: medium-large (approx. 20–26 pt).

3. Annotations (multiple short-form text boxes placed within the plot area, anchored to specific years)
   - Content & placement:
     - 2005–2007 cluster (anchor 2006): “Spain in surplus while Euro‑zone remained in deficit”
     - 2008–2011 crisis peak (anchor 2009): “Sharp drop in Spain after 2008 financial shock (2009 = -11.2%)”
     - 2012–2014 targets (anchored above each target bar cluster): “Government targets (projections)”
   - Style: compact multi-line text (6–20 words each), high-contrast background rectangle with subtle 1px border and a thin leader line pointing to the relevant bar(s).
   - Rationale: Annotation and WordCountAnnotation have strong positive loadings (0.65 each). This calls for multiple anchored annotations and a higher ratio of annotation words vs. title words. Annotations clarify key differences and highlight target vs actual values. Use annotations as the primary explanatory text inside the chart.

4. Value labels (direct labels on each bar)
   - Content: numeric value formatted as “-11.2%” or “2.4%”
   - Position: end of each bar (outside for positive bars above 0, outside for negative bars below 0) with 1–2 mm padding
   - Font: bold, large enough for presentation (approx. 14–18 pt)
   - Rationale: IdentifyValues loading is strongly positive (0.53). Directly labeling every bar ensures viewers can read precise values without searching for axis ticks. This supports comparison between Spain and the Euro‑zone.

5. Minimal legend / series labels (avoid separate legend where possible)
   - Instead of a large legend, place small, labeled color swatches at the top-left of the plotting area: “Spain” (filled swatch) and “Euro‑zone avg” (filled swatch).
   - Rationale: ReplaceMappings loading is positive (0.33) — reduce reliance on separate mapping constructs (long legends) and use embedded, compact mapping elements near the plot to make the mapping immediate and reduce cognitive load.

Visual styling (color, grid, lines, emphasis)
1. Color encoding (data-driven, not merely decorative)
   - Spain: saturated, high‑contrast blue (e.g., #0B6FC6).
   - Euro‑zone average: muted slate gray-blue (e.g., #7B8EA3).
   - Targets (Spain 2012–2014): same Spain hue but 40% opacity fill with a dashed 2px outline, or diagonal hatching.
   - Rationale: Style has a slightly negative loading (-0.21) — avoid decorative-only palettes. Use color to encode series identity clearly and consistently. The user asked to focus on differences — a brighter color for Spain draws attention to the primary comparison.

2. Axis, grid, and baseline
   - Y-axis label (left): “% of GDP (surplus / deficit)”, medium-large font (approx. 16–18 pt). Include only major tick labels every 5 points (e.g., -15, -10, -5, 0, 5).
   - Replace minor tick clutter by relying on direct value labels (per IdentifyValues) and sparse horizontal gridlines at major ticks.
   - Draw the 0 line as a darker dashed horizontal line to emphasize the surplus/deficit boundary.
   - Rationale: ReplaceMappings positive suggests moving some mapping responsibilities into direct labels and visual cues; sparse axis ticks plus the clear 0 baseline helps read surplus vs deficit quickly.

3. Bars and spacing
   - Bar width: moderate (occupy ~30–35% of the year bin each), with a small intra-year gap between Spain and EZ bars and larger inter-year gap to separate years visually.
   - Use vertical orientation with negative values extending downward from the 0 baseline.
   - Rationale: Standard paired bar layout supports direct year-by-year comparisons and the user requirement.

4. Annotations and leader lines
   - Use thin (1px) semi-transparent lines (same hue as annotation border) to connect annotation boxes to bars.
   - Keep annotation boxes lightweight: pale fill (e.g., 95% white with 6% gray border) so they float above the plot without obscuring many bars.
   - Rationale: Lines loading is slightly positive (0.25). Use thin connectors only where annotations require anchoring. Keep them unobtrusive and integrated.

5. Emphasis techniques for comparison
   - For years where Spain and Euro‑zone cross different sides of 0 (e.g., 2000, 2005–2007), add a very subtle vertical shading band behind those years to suggest notable divergence (light tint of Spain color at 6% opacity).
   - Rationale: Use minimal auxiliary visuals only when loadings justify them (Annotation, CompareMappings moderate at 0.26, ReplaceMappings positive). Subtle shading helps draw the eye to years of contrast without clutter.

6. Avoid government styling or branding
   - Do not use official government seals, color schemes, or formal wording in the title/caption. Phrase the data source neutrally: “Data: Eurostat; Spain targets = national projections.”
   - Rationale: Government source has a strong negative loading (-0.55). Avoid overt government-style presentation to align with the loadings.

Accessibility & presentation legibility
- Fonts: Sans-serif, high-contrast text. Title and subtitle large (title 36–48 pt; subtitle 20–26 pt). Axis labels and annotations large enough for presentation (axis 16–18 pt; annotation text 14–18 pt).
- Color contrast: ensure >4.5:1 for text on fills. Value labels use white text for filled bars if contrast requires it; otherwise dark text.
- Export at high resolution (300 dpi for slides) so thin lines and patterns remain crisp.

Specific mapping decisions tied to loadings (explicit)
- Add direct value labels on every bar (IdentifyValues 0.53): improves numeric readout and makes pairwise differences immediately readable without relying on the axis.
- Use several anchored annotations with longer relative text share than the title (Annotation 0.65; WordCountAnnotation 0.65): annotations call out the 2005–2007 surplus period, the 2008–2011 crisis, and that 2012–2014 are targets; this improves narrative clarity and supports the user’s desire to focus on differences.
- Keep the title minimal (WordCountTitle -0.63): prevents long titling from competing with rich annotations, aligns word-count loadings.
- Reduce government-style presentation and branding (Government -0.55): adopt neutral “news-style” explanatory phrasing and avoid official seal or formal report styling.
- Use embedded mapping cues rather than a prominent legend (ReplaceMappings 0.33): small labeled swatches adjacent to the plot reduce eye movement and map series to colors quickly.
- Use minimal leader lines and callouts (Lines 0.25): thin unobtrusive connectors only where annotations anchor to a specific bar, keeping visual clutter low.
- Use color to encode series identity and highlight differences (Style -0.21 negative — so color is purposeful rather than decorative). Choose high-contrast, data-driven hues rather than purely aesthetic gradients.
- Keep a short subtitle to convey timeframe and the nature of last three years (Subtitle 0.24). Avoid emotive framing (PresentValenced Subtext low positive = 0.22) — annotations may state implications neutrally.

Plot elements checklist (for implementation)
- Canvas: 900 × 1200 px, portrait.
- Title (short), subtitle (single line).
- Paired vertical bars for each year (1999–2014), Spain then Euro‑zone.
- Spain target bars (2012–2014): patterned/dashed outline + lower opacity.
- Direct numeric labels on every bar (one decimal, with % sign).
- 0 baseline emphasized (darker dashed line).
- Sparse y-axis ticks (major ticks at 5‑point intervals) with label “% of GDP (surplus/deficit)”.
- Small color swatches + inline labels near top-left replacing large legend.
- 3 anchored annotation callouts: 2005–2007, 2009 crisis, 2012–2014 targets; boxes with thin leader lines.
- Neutral data source line at bottom-right: “Data: Eurostat; Spain targets = national projections.”
- Export-ready fonts and sizes for presentation as specified.

How these choices improve readability and visual quality (summary)
- Large readable text and short title avoid clutter and support slide viewing.
- Direct value labels and targeted annotations (driven by high Annotation and IdentifyValues loadings) make numeric and narrative differences immediately clear.
- Minimal axis and embedded mappings (ReplaceMappings) reduce eye travel and make the paired comparison the visual priority.
- Purposeful color encoding (not decorative) emphasizes differences between Spain and the Euro‑zone while remaining accessible.
- Avoiding government styling and using neutral “news‑graphic” phrasing aligns with the loading structure and the user’s desire to emphasize differences rather than official presentation.
