Chart type
- Paired vertical bar chart (grouped bars per year: Spain vs Euro‑zone average), x-axis = Year, y-axis = Budget balance (% of GDP). Aspect ratio: portrait orientation at least 3:4 (e.g., 9 in width × 12 in height or 600 × 800 px minimum). Reasoning: paired bars directly support CompareValues (Loading 0.45) by making side‑by‑side differences visually immediate.

Overall layout and hierarchy
- Header row: left-aligned government logo (small), centered large title, optional one-line, very short subtitle (see Text structure). Government logo placement and clear source line reinforce Government (0.43) and Logos (0.52).
- Main chart area: large, tall plotting area occupying most of the vertical space so bars and annotations are large and readable in presentation.
- Annotations and summary callouts placed within the plot area close to highlighted bars, with thin connector lines where needed.
- Footer: single-line source/notes (left) and small logo repeat (right). Keep footer text small but legible.

Text structure (what text, content, and placement)
- Title (center, very large): “Spain vs. Euro‑Zone: Budget surplus/deficit (% of GDP), 1999–2014”
  - Tied to PresentContext (0.32) and CompareValues (0.45): states comparison and time range succinctly.
  - Size: 26–34 pt (presentation scale).
- Subtitle: omitted or reduced to a single concise phrase (right of title or directly below, 14–16 pt): “Focus: differences between Spain and the Euro‑zone average”
  - Rationale: WordCountSubtitle loading = -0.30 suggests shorten or exclude subtitle. Keep it minimal to reduce subtitle word share.
- Legend (top-right of plot area, large icons): two entries — Spain (red), Euro‑zone avg (EU blue). Use concise labels and large legend symbols (16–18 pt).
- Axis labels:
  - Y-axis label: “Budget balance (% of GDP)” — 16–18 pt, rotated as needed.
  - X-axis ticks: Years (every year, 1999–2014), tick labels 14–16 pt. Years spaced evenly to support paired bars.
- Data labels: selective value labels only (see CompareValues), not full IdentifyValues for every bar. Use short numeric labels for selected years (see Annotations below), 14–16 pt.
  - Rationale: IdentifyValues loading is low (0.22) while CompareValues (0.45) is high — label selectively where it aids direct comparison, not for every bar to avoid clutter.
- Footnote (lower-left, small): “2012–2014 are Spain’s government targets; euro‑zone averages not available for these years (NA). Source: [Government Agency].”
  - Rationale: PresentMetadata (0.22) & PresentContext (0.32) support minimal necessary metadata/context. Keep it one line; font 12–14 pt.

Visual styling (colors, marks, emphasis)
- Color palette:
  - Spain: warm red (use Spain‑branded red, muted so it’s legible on dark/white background).
  - Euro‑zone average: EU blue (distinct, medium saturation).
  - Neutral background: off‑white; gridlines light gray.
  - Rationale: Style (0.56) is a strong factor — use a cohesive branded palette (government palette if available) for visual polish while keeping data encoding clear.
- Positives vs. negatives:
  - Use same pair colors for both positive and negative bars (no extra hue for sign), but visually emphasize the zero baseline with a thicker horizontal line and subtle shading above/below to aid reading across sign changes.
  - Rationale: Keeps the color mapping simple (style-driven) while ensuring negative/positive is clear via baseline emphasis.
- Bar geometry:
  - Grouped bars per year with slight gap between pairs and larger gap between every 4 years for scanning.
  - Spain bar slightly in front or with a thin border to emphasize the focus on Spain.
- Missing data / targets:
  - For euro‑zone NA (2012–2014): show no euro bar; instead display a faded placeholder (light gray, 30% opacity) with “NA” notation above tick. For Spain’s 2012–2014 target bars: apply subtle diagonal hatch pattern (or 50% opacity) and a thin dashed outline to indicate “target” vs actual.
  - Rationale: PresentContext (0.32) and PresentMetadata (0.22) require clear indication of status; hatching + label keeps chart readable and conforms to government/official styling.
- Zero line:
  - Thicker, darker zero baseline with tick marks to orient positive vs deficit quickly.

Annotations and auxiliary elements (only where supported)
- Add targeted annotations (inline short text) for years that are most informative to the comparison: 2005, 2006, 2007 (Spain surplus vs euro deficit), 2009 (Spain extreme deficit), and the 2012–2014 targets.
  - Each annotation: one short phrase + numeric difference where relevant, e.g.:
    - 2005 (callout near pair): “Spain +1.3% vs EZ −2.4% → Spain ahead by 3.7 pp”
    - 2009: “Spain −11.2% vs EZ −6.3% → Spain deficit larger by 4.9 pp”
    - 2012–2014 (callout linked to hatched Spain bars): “Government targets (not actuals)”
  - Font: 14–16 pt, bold number, plain supporting text. Keep each annotation to one short sentence or phrase.
  - Rationale: Annotation loading 0.32 and CompareValues 0.45 strongly support selective inline annotations to call out comparisons and differences.
- Circles (small circular highlight outlines) around the specific Spain or pair of bars being annotated (2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2012–2014). Circle stroke thin, color neutral (dark gray) or slightly accent color; do not fill.
  - Rationale: Circles loading 0.31 supports lightweight circular emphasis. They direct attention without heavy decoration.
- Connector lines:
  - Thin straight or curved lines from circle to annotation text, using subtle gray and a small arrowhead only when needed.
  - Rationale: Lines loading 0.30 supports using lines as unobtrusive callout connectors.
- Icons:
  - Small icons beside annotation headings: up arrow or green plus for surplus years, down arrow or red minus/euro icon for deficit extremes; place icons next to the short phrase (about 12–14 pt).
  - Rationale: Icons (0.41) help quick comprehension and match the document’s government/public communication tone. Keep them small and consistent.

Data labeling and CompareValues implementations
- For the key annotated years, include both Spain and Euro numeric labels above/beside bars (14–16 pt). For other years, omit numeric labels to reduce clutter.
- Add a compact difference label where space allows (e.g., “Δ = +3.7 pp”) near the annotation of the pair being compared.
- Rationale: CompareValues (0.45) and SummarizeValues (0.36) favor direct numeric comparisons; selective labeling gives readers precise comparisons without overwhelming the plot.

Metadata / source and logos
- Source line (footer, left): “Source: [Government Agency], Fiscal Accounts.” Keep to one line, 12–14 pt.
- Government logo (small) in header left and optional repeat bottom-right — subtle, not taking focus from chart.
  - Rationale: Logos (0.52) and Government (0.43) are strong loadings — include government branding to match expectations for official publications, but keep it unobtrusive.

Word‑count and textual economy
- Keep all annotations short (one sentence each) and avoid any paragraph blocks in the chart area. Avoid multi-line subtitle or lengthy body paragraph.
- Overall text should be concise but present enough short annotations to satisfy WordCountTotal (0.54) influence — i.e., moderate amount of short, high‑value text rather than a long paragraph.
- Rationale: WordCountSubtitle negative (-0.30) calls for a minimal subtitle, while WordCountTotal positive suggests the chart can contain several concise textual elements (annotations, labels, short footnote).

Accessibility and legibility
- Large fonts sized for presentation: title 26–34 pt, axis labels 16–18 pt, tick labels 14–16 pt, annotations 14–16 pt.
- High-contrast colors for text vs background; ensure colorblind-safe palette (use different hatching/outline if necessary).
- Provide an accessible caption or alt text in the slide notes describing the key finding(s) in one or two sentences (e.g., “Spain posted surpluses in 2005–2007 while the Euro‑zone averaged deficits; Spain experienced a much larger deficit in 2009. 2012–2014 are government targets.”)
  - Rationale: PresentContext (0.32) and SummarizeValues (0.36) encourage a concise textual summary for accessibility and quick takeaway.

How these decisions map to the loadings (compact justification)
- Annotation (0.32) & CompareValues (0.45): Use targeted in-chart annotations and numeric difference callouts to spotlight the comparisons the user requested.
- Circles (0.31) & Lines (0.30): Lightweight circular highlights and thin connector lines to link annotations to bars in a non‑intrusive way.
- Icons (0.41): Small up/down/euro icons to reinforce surplus/deficit semantics visually.
- Logos (0.52) & Government (0.43): Include government logo and clear single-line source to signal official provenance.
- Style (0.56): Apply a neat, government‑appropriate color palette and polished typography to satisfy strong style loading while keeping data clarity.
- SummarizeValues (0.36) & PresentContext (0.32): Provide a short in-chart summary annotation and a brief footnote clarifying that 2012–2014 are targets and euro‑zone data are NA for those years.
- WordCountSubtitle (-0.30): Keep subtitle extremely short or omit; avoid multi-line subtitle.
- WordCountTotal (0.54): Favor multiple short annotations/labels (moderate overall word count made of many concise items) rather than long paragraphs. Avoid paragraph text (Paragraph loading 0.26 is low).

Implementation notes for the designer/engineer
- Data handling: treat NA values for euro‑zone as missing — do not plot bars for those years; show placeholder NA annotation.
- Export sizes: ensure final export at least 1200 × 1600 px or equivalent vector PDF for crisp presentation.
- Provide two variants: light background (default) and dark background (inverted colors), keeping same contrast and font sizes.

End result (viewer takeaway)
- A tall, presentation‑friendly paired bar chart that emphasizes the year‑by‑year differences between Spain and the Euro‑zone average, uses selective annotations and highlights to call out the most important comparisons (surplus years and the 2009 deficit), clearly marks target years and missing euro‑zone data, and carries subtle government branding and a polished stylistic treatment that maintains clarity and hierarchy.
