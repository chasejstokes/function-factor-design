For example: 
  “””
  Redesign the “Average Daily Screen Time by Age Group” bar chart while preserving the bar chart form. 
  First, shorten the title to “Screen Time by Age”
  Reasoning: The Word Count (Title) loading is strongly negative (-0.63), suggesting shorter or simplified titles. 

  Then, add direct annotations above each bar showing numeric values (e.g., “6.5 hrs/day” for 18–24). Include callouts for key insights like “Highest usage among young adults” for 18–24 and “Screen time decreases with age” for 55+.
  Reasoning: Both Annotation (0.65) and Word Count (Annotation) (0.65) have very strong positive loadings. According to definitions, annotations are short-form text placed directly within the display and anchored to data points. These high loadings indicate annotations should be the primary explanatory mechanism in the redesign.

  Use simple arrows to connect annotations to their target bars.
  Reasoning: Arrows have a positive loading (0.19), supporting their use as auxiliary visual elements. By definition, arrows direct attention toward specific chart areas, which aligns with Factor 2’s emphasis on annotation-driven explanation.

  Simplify the caption to attribution only (“Source: National Survey, 2024”).
  Reasoning: Present Metadata has a near-zero loading (0.03), meaning metadata is not emphasized in this factor. By definition, captions typically contain explanatory or supplementary text — but given annotation loadings, captions should be minimal and not serve as a primary explanatory channel.

  Keep all text black or dark gray.
  Reasoning: Style has a slightly negative loading (-0.21), which suggests avoiding decorative or aesthetic color usage in the text information.

  Be sure to keep the same chart type (e.g., bar chart stays a bar chart). Minor stylistic variations are acceptable (e.g., bar chart → bar chart with data labels), but the core visual design should remain intact.
