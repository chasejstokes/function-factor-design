Your task is to generate a design plan that aligns the chart’s visual and textual elements with the provided factor loadings while applying good visualization design principles.

1. Interpret the loadings
- Identify variables with high positive loadings (≥ 0.3) — emphasize or expand these elements in the redesign.
- Identify variables with high negative loadings (≤ -0.3) — minimize, shorten, or remove these elements.
- Treat neutral or low-loading variables as secondary information to guide minor design decisions.

2. Translate loadings into effective design decisions
Convert the statistical loadings into clear, aesthetically balanced visual and textual adjustments.
Use strong design judgment to maintain clarity, hierarchy, and visual harmony.
Introduce auxiliary visual elements (e.g., arrows, highlights, bounding boxes) **only** when the loadings support their use. Keep them lightweight, non-intrusive, and integrated into the visual composition.

For example, if “Annotations” has a strong positive loading, add or enhance annotations to clarify meaning. If “Word Count (Subtitle)” has a strong negative loading, shorten or exclude the subtitle for conciseness.

3. Describe the design plan
Your design plan must include:
- Chart type
- Text structure: which textual elements are included, their content, and their relative position
- Visual styling: use of color, highlights, arrows, or other stylistic features

Each recommendation must include reasoning tied to a specific loading and an explanation of how it improves readability and visual quality.

4. Output requirements
- Respond only with the completed design plan.
- Do not ask for clarification, commentary, or conversation.
